Custom relationship for Eloquent that merges/combines multiple one-to-may (hasMany) relationships.
This relation fully supports lazy and eager loading.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer with following command:

```bash
composer require korridor/laravel-has-many-merged
```

If you want to use this package with older Laravel/PHP version please install the 0.* version.

```bash
composer require korridor/laravel-has-many-merged "^0"
```

### Requirements

This package is tested for the following Laravel versions:

- 10.* (PHP 8.1, 8.2, 8.3)
- 11.* (PHP 8.2, 8.3)

## Usage examples

In the following example there are two models User and Message.
Each message has a sender and a receiver.
The User model has two hasMany relations - one for the sent messages and the other for the received ones.

With this plugin you can add a relation that contains sent and received messages of a user.

```php
use Korridor\LaravelHasManyMerged\HasManyMerged;
use Korridor\LaravelHasManyMerged\HasManyMergedRelation;

class User extends Model
{
    use HasManyMergedRelation;
    
    // ...

    /**
     * @return HasManyMerged<Message>
     */
    public function messages(): HasManyMerged
    {
        return $this->hasManyMerged(Message::class, ['sender_user_id', 'receiver_user_id']);
    }

    /**
     * @return HasMany<Message>
     */
    public function sentMessages(): HasMany
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Message::class, 'sender_user_id');
    }

    /**
     * @return HasMany<Message>
     */
    public function receivedMessages(): HasMany
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Message::class, 'receiver_user_id');
    }
}
```
